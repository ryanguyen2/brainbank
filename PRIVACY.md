# BrainBank Privacy Policy

_Last updated: August 2025_

BrainBank is a Chrome side-panel extension that helps you capture, transform, and save knowledge into a personal journal. We respect your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how your data is used.

---

## Information We Collect

BrainBank may collect the following information:

- **Highlighted text selections** — the content you choose to process with BrainBank’s presets.
- **Generated outputs** — the responses returned from the AI model.
- **Profile details** — optional username and chosen avatar.
- **Customization data** — themes, fonts, and other personalization options.
- **Usage data** — your streak count (consecutive days of use).

---

## How We Use Your Data

- **For AI processing**: When you highlight text and request a preset, the selected text is sent securely to the OpenAI API. The model processes it and returns a generated output.  
- **For storage**: Journal entries, themes, avatars, usernames, and streaks are stored locally in your browser’s `chrome.storage.sync`, which may sync across your Chrome profile if enabled.  
- **For personalization**: Profile and theme settings are only used to customize your extension experience.

## What We Do NOT Collect

- We do not collect or store personally identifiable information (PII) unless you choose to set a username yourself.  
- We do not log or sell your data to third parties.  
- We do not run analytics or tracking scripts inside the extension.  

---

## Data Sharing

- **OpenAI**: Highlighted text and prompts are shared with OpenAI’s API solely for the purpose of generating the requested output. Please see [OpenAI’s privacy policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy) for details.  
- **No other sharing**: We do not share your data with advertisers, marketers, or any other third parties.

## Security

- All API requests are sent over HTTPS to the OpenAI API.  
- Your journal data is stored locally in your browser’s secure extension storage (`chrome.storage.sync`).  

---

## Your Choices

- You may delete your journal entries, reset your streak, and change your profile at any time within the extension.  
- You can uninstall the extension at any time, which removes all stored data.
