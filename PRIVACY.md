# BrainBank Privacy Policy  

_Last updated: August 2025_  

BrainBank is a Chrome side-panel extension that helps you capture, transform, and save knowledge into a personal journal. We respect your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how your data is used.  

---

## Information We Collect  

BrainBank may process the following information **only when you use the extension’s features**:  

- **Highlighted text selections** — the content you choose to process with BrainBank’s presets.  
- **Generated outputs** — the responses returned from the AI model.  
- **Profile details** — OPTIONAL username and chosen avatar.  
- **Customization data** — themes, fonts, and other personalization options.  
- **Usage data** — your streak count (consecutive days of use).  

---

## How We Use Your Data  

- **For AI processing**: When you highlight text and request a preset, the selected text is securely sent to BrainBank’s backend server (`https://brainbank.onrender.com`), which forwards it to the OpenAI API for processing. The model processes it and returns a generated output.  
- **For storage**: Journal entries, themes, avatars, usernames, and streaks are stored locally in your browser’s `chrome.storage.sync`, which may sync across your Chrome profile if enabled.  
- **For personalization**: Profile and theme settings are only used to customize your extension experience.

## What We Do NOT Collect  

- We do not collect or store personally identifiable information (PII) unless you choose to set a username yourself.  
- We do not log, sell, or transfer your data to third parties outside of the use described above.  
- We do not use your data for advertising, analytics, or tracking.  

---

## Data Sharing  

- **OpenAI**: Highlighted text and prompts are shared with OpenAI’s API solely for the purpose of generating the requested output. Please see [OpenAI’s Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy) for details.  
- **No other sharing**: We do not share your data with advertisers, marketers, or any unrelated third parties.

## Security  

- All requests to our backend and the OpenAI API are sent over HTTPS.  
- Your journal data is stored locally in your browser’s secure extension storage (`chrome.storage.sync`).  

---

## Your Choices  

- You may delete your journal entries, reset your streak, and change your profile at any time within the extension.  
- You can uninstall the extension at any time, which removes all stored data.
